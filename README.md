## XML Files

- define what information you want in the repsonse. Like defining a schema.
- `Schema.from_aiml` reads in the `.aiml` file and parses it to make sure it's consistent with the dialect (e.g. `.aiml` dialect), ensures that the validators are registered for valid formatters. If you pass in formatters that don't exist, then it will raise a warning, but won't create any validation for those formatters. This also creates a prompt that is passed to the LLM

### Formatter
`two-words` is a formatter

### Validator


### Event Handlers
`on:fail:two-words={action}` is an event handler that takes a particular action when the two-words formatter fails.
