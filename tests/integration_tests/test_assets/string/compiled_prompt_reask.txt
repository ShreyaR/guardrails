I was given the following string, which had problems due to incorrect values.

{
  "incorrect_value": "sour cream tomata",
  "error_message": "must be exactly two words"
}

Help me correct the incorrect values based on the given error messages.

Given below is XML that describes the information to extract from this document and the tags to extract it into.

<output type="string" description="Name for the pizza" format="two-words" name="string"/>


ONLY return a valid string answer (no other text is necessary), where the string is formatted according to the XML format. Be correct and concise.

Here are examples of simple (XML, string) pairs that show the expected behavior:
- `<string format='two-words lower-case' />` => `{'foo': 'example one'}`
- `<string format='upper-case' />` => `{'bar': 'STRING ONE'}`
